# 👋 Hi, I’m Luciana Nunes

🚀 Product mind, dev heart — currently building tools at the intersection of clean code, GenAI, and automation. Based in Colorado, USA 🇺🇸.

### 💼 About Me

I'm a lifelong learner with 15+ years in tech, blending hands-on dev work with strategic product leadership. Since 2016, I’ve been a Product Manager at Thoughtworks, where I lead innovative, high-impact projects with cross-functional teams.

But once a builder, always a builder — I never stopped coding.

I'm currently focused on:

- ⚙️ **[TrophyHub](https://github.com/lcnunes09/trophyhub-backend)** – A backend platform to unify gaming achievements across Steam, PlayStation, Xbox, and more. TypeScript-first, Fastify-powered, tested with Vitest, and ready for scale.
- 🛠 **[CLI-Toolkit](https://github.com/lcnunes09/cli-toolkit)** – A lightweight, expressive CLI suite for Git automation, built to inspire others to hack their workflow.

---

### 🧠 Always Learning

- Full-stack TypeScript (Fastify, Prisma, Docker, Vitest)
- Advanced testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- GenAI APIs and ML-driven products
- Clean backend architecture and DX automation

### 🎮 Passion Projects

Gaming meets tech is my happy place. My 2025 goal: release my first game, combining narrative, creativity, and AI. I've been exploring game dev, emulators, achievements, and player-centric tools that inspire fun and progress.

### 💬 Let’s Connect

I'm open to:
- Code pairing and test-driven collabs
- Product career chats and mentorship
- GenAI experiments and OSS contributions

If you're building something cool or want to jam on ideas — reach out!
