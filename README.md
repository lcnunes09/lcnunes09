### Hello ✊🏼

🚀 I'm Luciana Nunes, currently living in Dallas, TX.

👩‍🎓 I have a degree in Information Systems. Also I have a MBA in Project Management.

🏅 I was part of three Hackathons in 2020: MegaHack, TecBan and Mega Hack Women. Now I just code for fun!

👯 As I love learning new things, I'm looking for someone to work together in different projects, pair, and share ideias! 

🚄 For future goals, I want to learn more Python, use Machine Learning and improve my experience on Data Analysis.

🦄 This is my current portifolio: https://lcnunes09.github.io/aboutme
