### Hello ✊🏼

👋 Hi, I'm Luciana Nunes, a passionate technologist and lifelong learner currently based in Colorado, USA.

🎓 I hold a degree in Information Systems and an MBA in Project Management, blending technical expertise with strategic leadership. With over 15 years in the IT industry (since 2007), I’ve worn many hats, like developer, scrum master, Project Manager, and currently I'm a Product Manager at Thoughtworks, where I’ve been driving innovative projects since 2016.

💻 While I enjoy my current role, my developer roots remain strong. I’m continuously sharpening my skills in Node.js and React, with an eye on creating impactful personal projects aimed at changing lives. I'm also exploring React Native and TypeScript as part of my growing tech stack.

🏆 Hackathons fuel my creativity! In 2020, I proudly participated in MegaHack, TecBan, and Mega Hack Women, collaborating with diverse teams to build solutions for real-world challenges.

🎮 Gaming and AI are my passions. My ambitious goal for 2025 is to release my first game: merging storytelling, creativity, and cutting-edge technology. Experimenting with AI always excites me, pushing my boundaries and opening new doors.

🤝 I love collaborating and sharing ideas! If you're passionate about innovation and keen to work on inspiring projects together, let's connect.
