### Hello ✊🏼

🚀 I'm Luciana Nunes, currently living in Recife, Pernambuco (Brazil).

👩‍🎓 I have a degree in Information Systems. Also I have a MBA in Project Management.

🖥️ I´m currently working at ThoughtWorks, as a Business Analyst (since 2016). However, as I have some personal projects to work on having the purpose of changing lifes, as well as I enjoy being a developer, I'm learning React and Node to complement my background of HTML, CSS and Javascript. Out of curiosity, I used to be a PHP developer for years! Also, I've been working on IT Industry since 2007.

🏅 I was part of two Hackathons in 2020: MegaHack and TecBan. Soon, I will be joining the Mega Hack Women!

👯 As I love learning new things, I'm looking for someone to work together in different projects and share ideias!

🚄 For future goals, I want to learn more Python and use Machine Learning and improve my experience on Data Analysis.

🦄 This is my current portifolio: https://lcnunes09.github.io/aboutme
